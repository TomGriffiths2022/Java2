Exceptions
----------
- What is an exception? 
  Something different from the norm./something unexpected
  The code is messed up
  It interrupts the normal flow of the code 
  An object that contains info about something that went wrong
  Represents an error - something has gone wrong

- Differntiate between checked and unchecked exceptions
  A checked exception:
  - The compiler will FORCE you to handle it 
  - Results from errors that are beyond your control
  - Just becuase the error is beyond your control does NOT mean you should not anticipate it
  - An anticipatable error that is beyond your control
  - e.g. FileNotFoundException, SQLException, etc.
  An unechecked exception:
  - The compiler is not involved (you will not be forced to handle it)
  - Results from errors that are your fault (coding mistakes)*
  * There are many Java frameworks that deliberately throw unchecked exceptions
  - e.g. NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.
