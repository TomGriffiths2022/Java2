Java Security
-------------
Securing Objects
- limit accessibility; start by making everything private; use ALL the access modifiers
- restrict extensibility; mark your classes/methods as final; use sealed classes
- make your constructors private if appropriate; make sure the object is created in the right way

Injection & Validation
- don't use JDBC Statements (when there is a "user value" in the query); use only PreparedStatement
- don't allow invalid or corrupt data into your application; write lots of tests

Confidential Info
- don't use toString() or at least carefully inspect what is generated
- use char[] (this is garbage collected) instead of String (this can exist in memory for potentially a long time)
- set sensitive data fields/variables to null when you're done with them
- take care with logs and sysouts; use assert instead e.g. assert x > 0;

Denial of Service
- don't leak resources; use try with resources
- avoid reading very large files
- don't let the caller dictate the size of your collections
